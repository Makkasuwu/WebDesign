This is an image scroller that can be implemented for your live streams.
The images are pulled off of an image server you have.
I used dropbox to pull my media from, but you can use any website that has a direct link to your image.
You can adjust how fast an item scrolls by opening the image_scroller file and following the in program comments. 
Currently it will endlessly scroll through at a slow speed.
