            <h3>Keeping your pet's chompers clean and healthy</h3>
            <p>You know the importance of brushing your own teeth, but did you know that dogs and cats also need regular attention to their pearly whites? Poor dental hygiene in pets can lead to periodontal disease, a bacterial infection which causes bad breath, drooling, tooth decay, and tooth loss.</p>
            <p>As always, if you have questions about your petâ€™s dental or health care, pleaseÂ <a href="contact.html">contact Wisdom Pet Medicine</a> for advice.</p>
