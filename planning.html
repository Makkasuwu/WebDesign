    <h1>Computer Setup</h1> 
    <p>Here are the computer requirements for running Runescape. Plus some commonly asked question
    	while trying to run the game.</p>
    
    <h2>Can Runescape run well on Laptops?</h2>
    
    <p>Though many people use desktops, runescape can in fact run
    	very well on laptops. I actually run runescape on my laptop. </p>
    
	<h2>What software do you need to run Runescape?</h2>
	
    <p>Runescape is a browser game, made from java code and some html5. You need to be able to have
    	a decent internet connection, Java downloaded(preferably the latest version) and adobe flash player
    	installed. Other than that, there are no more requirements for you computer to run the game!</p>	
    
    <h2>I don't want to play in the browser, is there a downloadable version?</h2>		
    
    <p>There is a downloadable version of the game, you can download it off the site. Yet you have
    	to be able to connect to the internet for the Client to load. There are also a few other clients you
    	can download, like swiftkit, RSbuddy, or ORION. I prefer swiftkit, and the original client above the others.
