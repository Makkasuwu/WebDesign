		<h3>What is Runescape?</h3>	
        
    <p> By now some of you are probably wondering by now. What on earth is that there Runescape game 
    	he keeps going on about. Well Runescape is a Massive Multi Online Role Playing Game. or MMORPG
    	for short. It's based on a land called Geilinor, it's a typical knights and dragon type of game. 
    	Some people may relate it to dungeons and dragons, or a type of World of Warcraft. The graphics are
    	not the best, but they're still updating them. They use html5 and java to create this game, so it can 
    	be pretty "laggy". </p>
    	
    <h2>What exactly is honorable Pking?</h2>
    
    <p>Honorable pking or player killing, is the act of playing the game without the intentions 
       of making another player mad. A few rules may be, asking for fights instead of straight up attacking them.
       Safing is also something that is looked down upon, as it doesn't give the other player the chance to 
       attempt combos, or anything else. It also leads to very boring fights, that may lead to no victor. Another
       rule that very righteous players follow is staying at the end of fights, Instead of tabbing out of them.
       even the most crude player killers will usually say "respect" in honor of a player who stayed for the whole
       fight. This trait is usually rare, as most prefer not to let another have their valuables.

    	 <h1>Computer Setup</h1> 
    <p>Here are the computer requirements for running Runescape. Plus some commonly asked question
    	while trying to run the game.</p>
    
    <h2>Can Runescape run well on Laptops?</h2>
    
    <p>Though many people use desktops, runescape can in fact run
    	very well on laptops. I actually run runescape on my laptop. </p>
    
	<h2>What software do you need to run Runescape?</h2>
	
    <p>Runescape is a browser game, made from java code and some html5. You need to be able to have
    	a decent internet connection, Java downloaded(preferably the latest version) and adobe flash player
    	installed. Other than that, there are no more requirements for you computer to run the game!</p>	
    
    <h2>I don't want to play in the browser, is there a downloadable version?</h2>		
    
    <p>There is a downloadable version of the game, you can download it off the site. Yet you have
    	to be able to connect to the internet for the Client to load. There are also a few other clients you
    	can download, like swiftkit, RSbuddy, or ORION. I prefer swiftkit, and the original client above the others.
